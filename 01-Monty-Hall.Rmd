# The Monty Hall Problem

Let's start with a puzzle so famous it's [appeared in Hollywood movies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zr_xWfThjJ0): the Monty Hall problem.


## Ask Marilyn

Marilyn vos Savant had the highest IQ ever recorded, until the *Guinness Book of Records* dropped that category in 1990 because of concerns about IQ tests.

In her "Ask Marilyn" column for *Parade* magazine, vos Savant answers hard questions from readers: puzzles, brain teasers, philosophical quandaries... you name it. When she published her answer to our first puzzle, a bunch of people with fancy credentials wrote in to complain she was wrong. Here was the question:

> Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors. Behind one door is a car, behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say #1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say #3, which has a goat. He says to you, "Do you want to pick door #2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice of doors?
---*Craig F. Whitaker, Columbia, Maryland*

If you're like me, your gut says it doesn't matter. There are two doors left; one has the car behind it; so they both have the same one-in-two chance of being a winner. Flip a coin, stick or move. It doesn't matter.

But Marilyn said you should switch! And you know what? She's right.

Why? Because the host knows where the car is, and he's not going to just show it to you. That means he effectively just told you it's behind behind door #2, unless you got lucky with your first pick of door #1. Because unless you got lucky on your first pick, his choice of which door to open was forced. He had to open door #3 to avoid showing you the car behind door #2. Again, that's assuming you were unlucky on your first pick of door #1. But that's a healthy two-in-three chance. So there's a two-in-three chance door #2 has the car.

Still don't believe me? It's okay, that's normal.

Here's how Marilyn convinced her readers to switch. Imagine the same game, but with 100 doors. You pick door #1, and the host opens every other door except, let's say, door #42. What do you think now, is it just a fifty-fifty shot? No way! Unless you got *very* lucky on your first pick and the car is behind door #1, you've just learned that the lucky door is #42.

*Still* don't believe me? That's okay, that's normal too! One of the most famous mathematicians of the 20th century wasn't convinced either. Paul Erdős published over 1,500 papers in mathematics, more than any other mathematician ever. A lot of his work was even advanced research in probability theory! But when his friend, Andrew Vázsonyi, told him about this puzzle, he wasn't having it. He kept asking Vázsonyi for a better explanation why he should switch. Vázsonyi even showed him a computer simulation he'd made of the game, where switching doors won the car two-thirds of the time. But Erdős still wanted a pure, mathematical explanation.

Fun facts about Erdős by the way: he basically lived for math. He would travel the world, visiting friends at their houses, often uninvited. He would drink coffee (and, eventually, take amphetamines) and do math with his host, until they solved whatever problem the host had been working on before Erdős showed up. Then he'd move on to the next house, and the next problem. He was such a character, and so ubiquitous, that mathematicians make a game of tracing their connection to him. Every mathematician has an "Erdős number". It's kind of like six degrees of Kevin Bacon. Erdős is number zero. People who coauthored with Erdős have number 1. People who coauthored with them have number 2. Their coauthors have number 3, and so on.


## Three Prisoners

In my last year as an undergraduate I took a class that changed my life. It literally defined my career as a philosopher. To this day, my career is devoted to the concepts, tools, and problems I met there for the first time.

One of those problems, which my professor assigned as homework, goes like this:

> Three prisoners, A, B, and C, are condemned to die in the morning. But the king decides in the night to pardon one of them. He makes his choice at random and communicates it to the guard, who is sworn to secrecy. She can only tell the prisoners that one of them will be released at dawn.
>
> Prisoner A welcomes the news, as he now has a 1/3 chance of survival. Hoping to go even further, he says to the guard, "I know you can’t tell me whether I am condemned or pardoned. But at least one other prisoner must still be condemned, so can you just name one who is?". The guard replies (truthfully) that B is still condemned. "Ok", says A, "then it’s either me or C who was pardoned. So my chance of survival has gone up to 1/2".
>
> Unfortunately for A, he is mistaken. But how?

This homework problem got me so turned inside out, I ended up writing a computer program to run simulations of it! Just like Vázsonyi. (Fools and wise men think alike, I guess.)

Well, my professor laughed. He called my computer simulation an "empirical" approach, and he didn't mean it as a compliment. Like Erdős, he wanted me to use *reason*, not a brute-force, computerized experiment.

Well, here's one reasoned argument that prisoner A is mistaken. By A's logic, their chances would also go down to 1/2 if the guard identified C instead of B. Because then there would be only one more prisoner to be released, with two candidates remaining: A and B. But if A's chances would be the same no matter what the guard said, then the guard's response couldn't possibly be informative. If your chances of having a certain disease are the same whether a certain medical test comes up positive or not, then the test must be useless, right?

This argument is right as far as it goes. But it doesn't really explain where the prisoner went wrong. It just tells us she must've gone wrong *somewhere*. But where?

I think the correct explanation involves a famous precept known as *The Total Evidence Requirement*. It says pretty much what it sounds like: to get the true probability of something, you have to take account of *all* the evidence you have. And the guard isn't just telling A that B is still condemned. She's also telling B, implicitly, that she *chose* to identify B as one of the condemned prisoners.

It's really counterintuitive that this extra information makes a difference. But it turns out to make all the difference in the world. Here's one way to see how.

A knows B can't be the pardoned prisoner, because the guard said so. So there are two possibilities remaining:

  - A is the pardoned prisoner.
  - C is the pardoned prisoner.

In the first scenario, where A has been pardoned, the guard had a choice between identifying B or C in her response. She chose to identify B, but she could have identified C instead. But in the second scenario, the guard had no choice. She had to name B, since she couldn't tell A that she's still condemned.

So when the guard says "B is still condemned", her report is exactly what you'd expect in the second scenario, where C was pardoned. Whereas in the first scenario, where A was pardoned, the guard's report was half as likely. She could just as easily have named C instead. So the guard's report fits twice as well with the second scenario. And that's why A's chance of survival is still 1/3.

This is essentially the same solution we used for the Monty Hall problem. And we can use a diagram to visualize it.

The king chooses one of the three prisoners at random, so each has the same 1/3 chance:

![](img/Three-Prisoner-Tree-1.png)

Then we consider the guard's options. If A is pardoned, she can choose to name either B or C. But if B is pardoned, she has to name C---otherwise she'll give away A's fate. And likewise, she has to name C if B is pardoned. So there are two possible outcomes where the guard names B:

![](img/Three-Prisoner-Tree-2.png)

And look! One of them is half as likely as the other, namely the one where A was pardoned. So when the guard names B, A's chance of having been pardoned is half that of still being condemned. In other words, her chance of survival is 1/3, versus a 2/3 chance of still being condemned.

So A's chances really do stay fixed. The guard's report is no reprieve. It makes no difference to A's chances, as seems right.


## Monty Hall Again

Erdős left Vázsonyi's house unsatisfied and unconvinced. But a few days later he called: someone had finally explained to his satisfaction why you should switch doors in the Monty Hall problem. "He proceeded to tell me the reasoning", said Vázsonyi, "but I couldn't fathom his explanation."

I guess we'll never know what persuaded Erdős. But luckily we don't need to, because the same technique we used on the three-prisoner puzzle works on Monty Hall. We can even use the same tree diagram, we just have to change the labels.

The first branching-point is now the placement of the car, and each door has the same 1/3 chance. The second branching-point is Monty's decision about which door to open. And just like the guard, his hand is forced in all but one case:

![](img/Monty-Hall-Tree.png)

Your initial choice was door #1, so if the car is behind door #2 Monty has to open door #3. Otherwise he'll be showing you that you have the wrong door. Likewise, he has to open #2 if the car is behind #3. Only if the car is behind #1 does Monty have a choice. So there are two possible situations where Monty opens door #3. But one of them is half as likely as the other, namely the one where the car is behind door #1. So, when you see Monty open door #3, the car is probably behind door #2. Switch!

The Total Evidence Requirement is clearly something to take seriously. To get the right answer, you have to take account of all the information you have. Monty isn't just showing you that door #3 is a bust, he's also likely giving something away with his choice of door to open.

So it's as important to consider *how* you get your information as it is to consider what information you got. These days there's a lot of talk about the dangers filter bubbles. But the news has always been a selective window onto the world, because only some things sell. "Man Bites Dog" is news, as journalists say, while "Dog Bites Man" is not. Or, to take a more political and realistic example from the recent news, "Seven Die in Terrorist Attack on London Bridge" is news, "Thousands Die Quietly of Cancer" is not.
