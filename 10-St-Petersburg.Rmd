# The St. Petersburg Paradox

In 1713 a mathematician named Nicolaus Bernoulli contemplated the following game:

> I'm going to flip a fair coin as many times as needed until it lands heads. When it does land heads, I'm going to stop and pay you a dollar amount according to the following scheme:
>
> - If the heads happens on the first toss, you get $2.
> - If the heads happens on the second toss, you get $4.
> - If the heads happens on the third toss, you get $8.
> - Etc.

The general pattern here is that you get $\$(2 \times 2 \times \ldots) = \$2^n$, where $n$ is the number of tosses. If it takes 3 tosses to get a heads, then you get $\$2^3 = \$8$. If it takes 10 tosses, you get $\$2^{10} = \$1,024$. And so on.

This might seem uncharacteristically generous of me, and in truth it is. I'm actually going to charge you a fee up front to get in on this game. The question is, how much are you willing to pay?

Probably not very much. After all, you'll probably only win a few bucks. The probability of winning at most $8 is 7/8, for example, or 87.5%. And the probability is about 98% that you'll win less than $100.

What's the EMV though? Well there's a 1/2 chance of winning $2, a 1/4 chance of winning $4, a 1/8 chance of winning $8... so:
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    EMV &= 1/2 \times \$2 + 1/4 \times \$4 + \ldots + 1/2^n \times \$2^n + \ldots\\
        &= \$1 + \$1 + \ldots + \$1 + \ldots\\
        &= \infty.
  \end{aligned}
$$

Now here's the paradox. A game with infinite expected value is one you should be willing to pay any price to pay. Because infinity minus any finite number is still infinity. Whether I demand $10, $100, or $1,000,000 to play, the game still has infinite expected value. And yet, intuitively, the game isn't worth more than a few dollars.


## Bernoulli's Solution

Nicholas Bernoulli devised this puzzle to challenge the idea that we should use expected value to determine the best decision. But the puzzle gets its name from his cousin Daniel Bernoulli, who published a famous response in the *St. Petersburg Academy Proceedings* in 1738.

Daniel's answer to his cousin's puzzle was based on an insight of yet another mathematician, Gabriel Cramer. The value of a dollar, Cramer realized, depends on how many dollars you heavy already. To someone destitute, a dollar can make the difference between eating lunch and going hungry. But to a billionaire, one more dollar makes no noticeable difference.

Or consider how a million dollars might change your life, compared to (say) Mark Zuckerberg's. With a million dollars you might quit your job, or change careers entirely, or move from a small rented apartment to a large house. But for Mark Zuckerberg, well... I suspect there isn't much he could do with that extra million that he can't do already.

So, Bernoulli concluded, while the dollar amounts may double and double in the St. Petersburg game, the *utilities* do not. Because winning $4 is not twice as valuable as winning $2; winning $8 is not twice as good as winning $2; and so on. As the dollar amounts double, the utility to be had does increase, but by less and less each time.

Exactly how much better is $4 than $2 then? And $8 over $4?

Bernoulli argued that as dollar rewards go up, utility increases "logarithmically". In visual terms:

More precisely, Bernoulli's idea was that the utility of $\$x$ is given by the logarithm function, $\ln$. So $U(\$x) = \ln(\$x)$.

Bernoulli then demonstrated that the expected *utility* of the St. Petersburg game---as opposed to its expected *monetary value*---ends up being finite. More exactly, it ends up being $\ln(4)$, the equivalent in utiles of about \$4. Which lines up pretty well with what most people are willing pay to play!


## St. Petersburg's Revenge

Sadly, Bernoulli's solution only offers short-lived relief. The paradox bounces right back. We just have to change the rewards so that they double in utiles instead of dollars.

Imagine the game now works as follows:

- If the heads happens on the first toss, you get 2 utiles.
- If the heads happens on the second toss, you get 4 utiles.
- If the heads happens on the third toss, you get 8 utiles.
- Etc.

The exact same calculation we did with money now shows that this game has infinite expected utility. So you should be willing to sacrifice anything to play.

Hmmm... can we always double the utility of the rewards though? Is there no  limit on how much good the game can deliver?

Not if we take Bernoulli's solution seriously. There is no upper bound on the logarithm function, it just keeps increasing forever and ever.

The increases do get smaller and smaller as the number of dollars increases, as the graph suggests. But they are still limitless. If you go far enough out to the right, you will eventually double the amount of utility you started from. There's even a simple equation for figuring out how many more dollars you need to double the utility. (For the mathematically inclined, the dollar payouts go like this: $\$e^2, \$e^4, \$e^6$, etc.)

On the other hand, there's only so much money in the world. Even if the government agreed to create as much money as needed to cover the game, there would only be so much you could do with it. At some point, there just won't be any more material goods to buy. And there's only so much you can pay other people to do to make your life---or the world as a whole---better.


## God Comes to St. Petersburg

Still, these limitations don't seem like the right kind. Our world may be imperfect. And our potential may be bounded by our physical and social natures.

But shouldn't the laws of reason transcend those contingencies? Shouldn't the rational decision still be rational even if our lives had infinite potential?

Imagine God appears to you and offers to play the St. Petersburg game. The rewards now are days in paradise. And with God's limitless powers, there is no limit to the amount of good you can enjoy there: you will never get bored of heaven's rewards.

And no more of this logarithm business! Each day in heaven adds as much good to your existence as the last. God will see to that.

Now the St. Petersburg game really does have infinite expected utility.

But God also demands a price to play, to be exacted in days in hell. To play the divine St. Petersburg game, you must first spend a thousand years with the damned. Each day in hell is an agony, but a finite one (we may suppose). So God's price is finite. But it is incredibly steep. And most likely that millennium of suffering will only be rewarded with handful of days in heaven. Your chances of winning more than 64 days in heaven, for example, are less than 2%.

Will you play God's St. Petersburg game? Even if I were convinced it was the rational choice, I don't think I could bring myself to do it.
