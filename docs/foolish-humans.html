<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Foolish Humans</h1>
<p>Marilyn vos Savant has the highest IQ ever recorded. At least, the <em>Guinness Book of Records</em> said so until they dropped this category in 1990 on the grounds that IQ tests weren’t reliable enough.</p>
<p>But we’ll come back to IQ-bashing later. What I’m getting at is: she’s famous for being smart. She even writes a column for <em>Parade</em> magazine (“Ask Marilyn”) where she answers hard questions from readers: puzzles, brain teasers, philosophical quandaries… you name it.</p>
<p>She might be most famous for the time she got one of these questions right, but a bunch of people with fancy credentials wrote in to complain she was wrong. What was the question?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors. Behind one door is a car, behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say #1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say #3, which has a goat. He says to you, “Do you want to pick door #2?” Is it to your advantage to switch your choice of doors? —<em>Craig F. Whitaker, Columbia, Maryland</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’re like me, your gut says it doesn’t matter. There are two doors left; one has the car behind it; so they both have the same one-in-two chance of being a winner. Flip a coin, stick or move. It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>But Marilyn says you should switch! And you know what? She’s right.</p>
<p>Why? Because the host knows where the car is, and he’s not going to just show it to you. That means he effectively just told you it’s behind behind door #2, unless you got lucky with your first pick of door #1. Because unless you got lucky on your first pick, his choice of which door to open was forced. He had to open door #3 to avoid showing you the car behind door #2. Unless, again, you got lucky on your first pick. But that’s only a one-in-three chance. So there’s a two-in-three chance door #2 has the car.</p>
<p>Still don’t believe me? It’s okay, that’s normal.</p>
<p>Here’s how Marilyn convinced her readers to switch. Imagine the same game, but with 100 doors. You pick door #1, and the host opens every single other door except one, let’s say #42. What do you think now, is it just a fifty-fifty shot? No way! Unless you got <em>very</em> lucky on your first pick and the car is behind door #1, you’ve just learned that the lucky door is #42.</p>
<p><em>Still</em> don’t believe me?? That’s okay, that’s normal too! One of the most famous mathematicians of the 20th century wasn’t convinced either. Paul Erdős published over 1,500 papers in mathematics, more than any other mathematician ever. A lot of them were even advanced work in probability theory! But when his friend, Andrew Vázsonyi, told him about this puzzle, he wasn’t having it. He kept asking Vázsonyi for a better explanation why he should switch. Vázsonyi even showed him a computer simulation he’d made of the game, where switching doors won the car two-thirds of the time. But Erdős still wanted a pure, mathematical explanation.</p>
<p>(Erdős basically lived for math. He would travel the world, visiting friends at their houses, often uninvited. He would drink coffee (and, eventually, take methamphetamine) and do math with his host, until whatever problem they had been working on before he showed up was solved. Then he’d move on to the next house, and the next problem. He was such a character, and so ubiquitous, that mathematicians make a game of tracing their connections to him. Every mathematician has an “Erdős number”. It’s kind of like six degrees of Kevin Bacon. People who coauthored papers with Erdős have number 1. People who coauthored with them have number 2. Their coauthors have number 3. And so on. (My number is 5. That may not sound like much, but keep in mind that most people have an Erdős number of <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>—no chain of coauthorship traceable to Erdős.)</p>
