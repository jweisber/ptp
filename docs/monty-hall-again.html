<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Monty Hall Again</h2>
<p>Erdős left Vázsonyi’s house unsatisfied and unconvinced. But a few days later he called: someone had finally explained to his satisfaction why you should switch doors in the Monty Hall problem. “He proceeded to tell me the reasoning”, said Vázsonyi, “but I couldn’t fathom his explanation.”</p>
<p>I guess we’ll never know what persuaded Erdős. But luckily we don’t need to, because the same technique we used on the three-prisoner puzzle works on Monty Hall.</p>
<p>We can even use the same tree diagram, we just have to change the labels. The first branching-point now corresponds to the placement of the prize, where each door has the same 1/3 probability: [Tree Diagram 3] The second tier of branches represents Monty’s decision about which door to open. And same as the guard, his hand is forced in all but one case. Recall: your initial choice was door A. So if the prize is behind door B, Monty has to open door C. Otherwise he’ll be showing you that you have the wrong door. Likewise, he has to open B if the prize is behind C. Only if the prize is behind A does Monty have a choice. So there are two possible situations where Monty opens door B: [Tree Diagram 4] But one of them is half as likely as the other, namely the one where the prize is behind door A. So the prize is more likely behind door C. Switch!</p>
<p>The Principle of Total Evidence is clearly something to take seriously. To get the right answer, you have to take account of all the information you have. Monty isn’t just showing you that door B is a bust, he’s also telling you he’s chosen to give you that information.</p>
<p>Here’s another way of think about this lesson. It’s as important to consider <em>how</em> you get your information as it is to consider what information you got. These days there’s a lot of talk about the dangers filter bubbles. But the news has always been a selective window onto the world, because only some things sell. “Man Bites Dog” is news, as journalists say, but “Dog Bites Man” is not. To take a more political and more realistic example from the recent news: “Seven Die in Terrorist Attack on London Bridge” is news while “Thousands Die Quietly of Cancer” is not.</p>
